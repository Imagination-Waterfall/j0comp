Working Items:
	Datatypes:
		Integers

	Operators:
	+, -, *, /, %, --, ++
	>, <, <=, >=, ==, !=, &&

	Control Flow:
	If statements (no else or else if)

Errors:
	-Output file will be in the same directory as the inputfile.
	-Literally everything else in j0 spec doesn't generate code

I've included test cases for the things I got to work. They are in /test/hw6testcases.

Apologies for the incompleteness of this homework, I messed up on type checking
and it snowballed from there.
